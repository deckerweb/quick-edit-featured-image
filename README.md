# Quick Edit Featured Image

This lightweight plugin allows to set and remove a Featured Image via the Quick Edit action screen in Post Type List Tables within the WordPress Admin. Out of the box this works for Posts, Pages and any public Post Type which supports Featured Images. (Can be disabled indiviually via code snippet or filter.)

## Description 

#### How this Plugin Works

1. Adds a new column to the List Table for Posts, Pages, Post Types â€“ if these support Featured Image and are public (post type needs support for `thumbnail` in WordPress terms)
2. Adds the Featured Image to **Quick Edit** (inline edit) â€“ this saves a lot of clicks & time to set or remove a featured image for a lot of posts (no longer opening the post, setup, save, close tab or going back in browser ...)
3. Placeholder icon image for all Posts/ Post Types that have no featured image yet â€“ clicking on icon opens _Quick Edit_

**Saves time for admins, site builders and editors!**

Note, the following post types are disabled by default because they either have thumbnail support or are internal
* _WooCommerce_ `product` (if WooCommerce is active)
* _Meta Box_ (including _AOI_ as well as _Lite_ plugin suites)  `meta-box`, `mb-post-type`, `mb-taxonomy`, `mb-relationship', `mb-settings-page`, `mb-views`

## Custom Tweaks

#### via Constant:

To exclude a post type from the adding of the Featured Image column, just add a constant to your `wp-config.php` file, to a functions.php (of theme or child theme) or via a code snippet plugin. Here's an example â€“ define the constant and add an array of post type slugs (note the square brackets which forming the array!):
```
define( 'QEFI_DISABLED_TYPES', [ 'woohoo-post-type', 'book', 'download-manager-plugin' ] );
```

That would result in **NO** Featured Image column and **NO** quick edit feature for these post type slugs: `woohoo-post-type`, `book` and `download-manager-plugin`

NOTE: The declaration needs every post type slug to be in single quotes, comma separated and the whole thing enclosed in square brackets like in the example above. 


#### via Filter (for developers):

Developers can use the filter `'ddw/quick_edit/post_types_disable'` --> is defined in class method `post_types_disable()`
This can be used to define which post types should not be supported (or should still be supported ...).

Typical usage:
```
add_filter( 'ddw/quick_edit/post_types_disable', 'prefix_your_custom_function' );
function prefix_your_custom_function( $post_types_disable ) {

	// do your stuff
	
	return (array) $post_types_disable;
}
```

## Frequently Asked Questions 

### Why not using an admin columns plugin? 
Good question. But these type of plugins usually only tweak the appearance of the post type list table and add an image column. Most of them do not offer the quick editing.


### Why did you create this plugin? 
I saw and found the code snippet to achieve this feature. It was amazing and I know I wanted that for myself and all client sites. When looking at the code snippet I wanted some enhancements so the decision was made to make a plugin out of it.


### Why is this plugin not on wordpress.org plugin repository? 
Because the restrictions there for plugin authors are becoming more and more. It would be possible, yes, but I don't want that anymore. The same for limited support forums for plugin authors on .org. I have decided to leave this whole thing behind me.

## Plugin Scope / Disclaimer

This plugin comes as is.

_Disclaimer 1:_ So far I will support the plugin for breaking errors to keep it working. Otherwise support will be very limited. Also, it will NEVER be released to WordPress.org Plugin Repository for a lot of reasons (ah, thanks, Matt!).

_Disclaimer 2:_ All of the above might change. I do all this stuff only in my spare time.

_Most of all:_ Have fun building great sites!!! ;-)
