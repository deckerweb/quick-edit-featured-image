# Quick Edit Featured Image

This lightweight plugin allows to set and remove a Featured Image via the Quick Edit action screen in Post Type List Tables within the WordPress Admin. Out of the box this works for Posts, Pages and any public Post Type which supports Featured Images. (Can be disabled indiviually via code snippet or filter.)

Also NOTE: When using the snippet version you have to re-save the Permalinks in WordPress _after activating_ the code snippet!

âž” Please decide for _one_ of both alternatives!

## Description 

#### How this Plugin Works

1. Adds a new column to the List Table for Posts, Pages, Post Types â€“ if these support Featured Image and are public (post type needs support for `thumbnail` in WordPress terms)
2. Adds the Featured Image to **Quick Edit** (inline edit) â€“ this saves a lot of clicks & time to set or remove a featured image for a lot of posts (no longer opening the post, setup, save, close tab or going back in browser ...)
3. Placeholder icon image for all Posts/ Post Types that have no featured image yet â€“ clicking on icon opens _Quick Edit_

**Saves time for admins, site builders and editors!**

Note, the following post types are disabled by default because they either have thumbnail support or are internal
* _WooCommerce_ `product` (if WooCommerce is active)
* _Meta Box_ (including _AOI_ as well as _Lite_ plugin suites)  `meta-box`, `mb-post-type`, `mb-taxonomy`, `mb-relationship', `mb-settings-page`, `mb-views`

---

## Custom Tweaks

### via Constant:

#### 1) Exclude Post Type(s):
To exclude a post type from the adding of the Featured Image column, just add a constant to your `wp-config.php` file, to a functions.php (of theme or child theme) or via a code snippet plugin. Here's an example â€“ define the constant and add an array of post type slugs (note the square brackets which forming the array!):
```
define( 'QEFI_DISABLED_TYPES', [ 'woohoo-post-type', 'book', 'download-manager-plugin' ] );
```

That would result in **NO** Featured Image column and **NO** quick edit feature for these post type slugs: `woohoo-post-type`, `book` and `download-manager-plugin`

NOTE: The declaration needs every post type slug to be in single quotes, comma separated and the whole thing enclosed in square brackets like in the example above. 


#### 2) Use German Translations for Code Snippet Version:
If you use the snippet version of the "plugin" (since v1.3.0) and want Germanized labels/strings then just define in a little snippet:
```
define( 'QEFI_GERMAN_STRINGS', 'ja' );
```
That's all! (For another alternative, see under [Translations](#translations))


### via Filter (for developers):

Developers can use the filter `'ddw/quick_edit/post_types_disable'` --> is defined in class method `post_types_disable()`
This can be used to define which post types should not be supported (or should still be supported ...).

Typical usage:
```
add_filter( 'ddw/quick_edit/post_types_disable', 'prefix_your_custom_function' );
function prefix_your_custom_function( $post_types_disable ) {

	// do your stuff
	
	return (array) $post_types_disable;
}
```

## Translations 

Translations get loaded by the proven standard of WordPress (and _ClassicPress_). Since non .org-plugins are in some way "second class" now the plugin has its own translation loader (with default functions!). That way **you can also use translations for Code Snippet version of the "plugin"** (since v1.3.0). The only thing you have to do, upload the language files to this folder (create it first):
```
/wp-content/languages/quick-edit-featured-image/
```

Adding the language files would look something like that:
```
/wp-content/languages/quick-edit-featured-image/quick-edit-featured-image-de_DE.l10n.php
/wp-content/languages/quick-edit-featured-image/quick-edit-featured-image-de_DE_formal.l10n.php
/wp-content/languages/quick-edit-featured-image/quick-edit-featured-image-fr_FR.l10n.php
```
As you can see these are `l10n.php` files already â€“ which is the new WordPress standard since WP 6.5
You can still use the "old" `.mo` files like so:
```
/wp-content/languages/quick-edit-featured-image/quick-edit-featured-image-de_DE.mo
/wp-content/languages/quick-edit-featured-image/quick-edit-featured-image-de_DE_formal.mo
/wp-content/languages/quick-edit-featured-image/quick-edit-featured-image-fr_FR.mo
```
The easiest way to create your own translations is with the packaged `.pot` file and the app _Poedit_ â€“ which can also create the `l10n.php` files since _Poedit 3.6_!

NOTE: This folder location is update-safe and will not overwritten by WordPress when updating language packs (for WP, Plugins, Themes). Updates to translations you need to handle yourself (that's the price of freedom from .org).

## Frequently Asked Questions 

### Why not using an admin columns plugin? 
Good question. But these type of plugins usually only tweak the appearance of the post type list table and add an image column. Most of them _do not offer_ the **quick editing**. A preview of the image in the table view is always fine but just setting or editing it is much better ðŸ˜‰.


### Can I use this plugin with _ClassicPress_? 
Yes, you can! It works perfectly fine, I tested it with _ClassicPress_ 2.4.x without any issues. It will be a great helper tool for any _ClassicPress_ user, too! ... and it fully supports the "ClassicPress spirit" ðŸ˜€.


### Why did you create this plugin? 
I saw and found the code snippet to achieve this feature. It was amazing and I know I wanted that for myself and all my client sites. When looking at the code snippet I wanted some enhancements so the decision was made to make a nice polished plugin out of it.


### Why is this plugin not on wordpress.org plugin repository? 
Because the restrictions there for plugin authors are becoming more and more. It would be possible, yes, but I don't want that anymore. The same for limited support forums for plugin authors on .org. I have decided to leave this whole thing behind me.

_Disclaimer 2:_ All of the above might change. I do all this stuff only in my spare time.

_Most of all:_ Have fun building great sites!!! ;-)
